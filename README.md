- 👋 Hi, I’m @ConeFir, an entry-level coder in Python living in the Twin Cities. I recently got my doctorate from Notre Dame in History and Philosophy of Science.
- 👀 I’m interested in doing things with Python, including web development and machine learning in TensorFlow. I also do music, watercolor, and on occassion, philosophy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TensorFlow and all of the myriad functionalities of Google Cloud API.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on literally anything you'll let me!
